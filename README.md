Predict the possibility of occurrence of chronic heart disease.

Note: This project is still in progress.

Overview:
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) and draw conclusions about each feature. These conclusions may come in handy for feature engineering.
- Select best 'k' features.
- Aim is to know, which algorithm does the best job of classifying.
- Train all models without hyper-parameter tuning to set a starting point or Benchmark.
- Now go for hyper-parameter tuning of the models, to increase the results from the benchmark results.
- Select the best performing model.
